# FACE Templating Language

The Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACE) work originally commissioned by the US Navy and eventually supported by the USAF and USArmy.  Interest in the data definition portion generally resulted in a decision to split UDDL out of FACE for general use. This repo thus depends on 
companion repos [UDDL](https://github.com/Epistimis/com.epistimis.uddl.parent) and [UDDL Query Language](https://github.com/Epistimis/com.epistimis.uddl.query.parent).
There isn't a build dependency with them yet - there will be.

The [current specification is available](https://publications.opengroup.org/standards/face/c207) for free after to you create an [OpenGroup](https://www.opengroup.org) account.  
This repo implements the FACE Template Specification gramar (Appendix J.3).

This code is based on that spec but is 'unofficial'. It does not use the namespace/packaging from the original spec which results in some minor 
modifications.  Other than that, it should be functionally equivalent.

The syntax used in the project is from the 'official' FACE spec. 

# Getting started

See the [UDDL Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/Epistimis/com.epistimis.uddl.parent/blob/0478f25fcb65772d6c26a104481c982113e73c20/GETTING_STARTED.md) for info on setting up an Eclipse development environment. It will take you all the way to a working demo.
